								<span class="image main">

								<p>
									Hi there! My name is Sarah. Welcome to my blog!
								</p>
								<p>
									Here is some background on me: I have two degrees in physics, with a research background in astronomy. 
									I am extremely passionate about space, science, and education. After graduating with my M.S. in Physics 
									and Astronomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was hard pressed to find a job in my field. In this time, 
									I reflected on my past experiences, and thought of a plan to move forward. During my career I had been a 
									tutor, teaching assistant, and planetarium lecturer. It became clear to me that not only was I passionate 
									about physics and astronomy, but about education too! I had done it informally for the better part of a 
									decade. So, I did what any sane (and completely non-masochistic) person would do and enroll in college 
									again for the third time—this time at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM).
								</p>
								<p>
									This time around, I am enrolled in the MACSTEP Program at UWM to get my teaching certification in Physics, 
									as well as a Master’s in Curriculum & Instruction. Starting in fall of 2021, I will be teaching physics and 
									precalculus at a high school in Milwaukee. In this year, I hope to learn how to be the best teacher I 
									possibly can be, and to be a positive influence in the lives of my students. 

								</p>
								<p>
									One of my favorite physics websites is <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">PhET</a> by the University of Colorado 
									Boulder. They have simulations for many different physics concepts, which will be a great tool to help my 
									students visualize these phenomena. I look forward to incorporating it into my classroom!
